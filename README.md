# Furmap

This website is NOT the official furmap. I simply created it as an exercise. 
You can still register, but beware it is not the official one.

This website aims to show you the furries around you. Everyone is free to subscribe! However, to avoid spam, you need a verifiable e-mail adress.
Do not worry, no newsletter or similar will be sent to you.

You will then appear for everyone on the map!

Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), and powered by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
